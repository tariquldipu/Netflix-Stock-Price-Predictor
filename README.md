## Netflix Stock Price Predictor

#python #machine_learning #keras #LSTM

Here, I have tried to make some simple predictions of  stock price of the popular OTT streaming platform [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) (NFLX) using Python and Machine Learning techniques. Here [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) neural network is used, as it is one of best approaches for regression analysis and time series forecasting. The stock data is sourced from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX?p=NFLX&.tsrc=fin-srch) using the yfinance API. The Jupyter IPython Notebook included in this repository is pretty much self-explanatory with all the necessary details included at every step. This notebook was composed inside [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

**Used Libraries-** pandas, yfinance, sklearn, keras, numpy, datetime, plotly

At the time of creating this notebook, the Netflix stock prices were considered up to the date November 08, 2022.
